# CSS Challenges

I've been studying CSS for a couple days and decided it's time to put what I learned to the test by completing the challenges in this codecademy tutorial on Youtube: 

[CSS Challenges Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzuWIHGFKCQ&list=TLPQMDQwODIwMjXvaTXlnE9G5g&index=4)

I completed all of these on my own, and then referenced the solution in the video to see how my code could be improved. So for any hiring managers out there, these challenges serve a good demonstration of what I can do with CSS! Check it out: [CSS Challenges: Demo](https://kilian-zindel.github.io/css_challenges/)
